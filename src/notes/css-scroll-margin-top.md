You know that annoying thing when you're scrolled to an anchor and the site's sticky header covers it up?

```css
.heading {
  scroll-margin-top: 72px;
}
```

Browser support: Works natively in Chrome, FF, Edge, Opera. Supported in Safari, but with a non-standard property, `scroll-snap-margin-top`.
